# BootStrap-4-and-GitHub-Pages

Welcome to the **BootStrap-4-and-GitHub-Pages** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for web designers and developers interested in using Bootstrap 4 to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces, and deploying these interfaces using GitHub Pages. This guide is ideal for anyone looking to harness the power of modern UI frameworks alongside efficient hosting solutions.

## Project Overview

This project is structured to facilitate easy learning and application of Bootstrap 4 combined with the deployment capabilities of GitHub Pages. The repository is divided into several key sections:

- **/docs**: Contains the compiled and minified versions of your Bootstrap site ready for deployment to GitHub Pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/bootstrap.min.css">
    <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling extra attention to featured content.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Learn more</button>
    </div>
